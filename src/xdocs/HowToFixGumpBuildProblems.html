<h1>How To Fix Gump Build Problems</h1>
<p>This document is targetted at developers who have received an e=mail
from gump and who now want to figure out what to do.</p>
<h2>Asking for help</h2>
<p>We know gump is far from trivial to use and administer. Fortunately,
the gump community consists of a large bunch of very helpful and
knowledgeable folks. If you have trouble understanding what's going on,
please do not hesistate and just ask us questions!
</p>
<p>That said, we do try to write good documentation, so as usual that
should be your first source of answers.
</p>
<h2>Possible notifications</h2>
<h3>Build success notifications</h3>
<p>If a project has been successfully built after failing for a while,
gump will send the maintainers of that project an e-mail. You don't
have to do anything when this happens. Here's an example:
</p>
<pre>From: Daily gump build <general @gump.apache.org=""><br>To: FooBar Development List <dev
 @foobar.apache.org=""><br>Subject: [Gump] Build success: foobar-blah<br><br>You do not need to do anything with this e-mail. It is purely informational.<br><br>After failing to build foobar-blah for 11 days, tonight's build of foobar-blah<br>completed successfully. This will benefit 23 dependent projects. Thanks to<br>everyone who helped fix the issue(s) surrounding the foobar-blah gump build!<br><br>More information on foobar-blah in relation to gump can be found at:<br><br>  https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/<br><br><br>best regards,<br><br><br>- Apache Gump, your continuous integration system<br><br>---<br>You received this e-mail because your project participates in the gump buildsystem.<br>You can configure what notifications gump sends you. Please visit<br>https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/notification-settings for more information.<br></dev></general></pre>
<h3>Dependency failure notifications</h3>
<p>If a piece of software that your project is using (a dependency) has
not successfully built for a while, gump will send you an e-mail. This
is an issue because your project cannot be built against the latest
version of that dependency, and incompatible changes might be
introduced there without you being aware of that.
</p>
<p>You should probably pay special attention to this dependency. The
maintainers of that software will also have been notified of the
problem, so immediate action is not normally required. Here is an
example message:
</p>
<pre>From: Daily gump build <general @gump.apache.org=""><br>To: FooBar Development List <dev
 @foobar.apache.org=""><br>Subject: [Gump] Dependency wombat-foo is failing to build<br><br>Your project is dependent on wombat-foo, which gump has not successfully built for<br>3 days. If this is the first time you receive a message like this, you probably<br>don't need to do anything, since the wombat-foo developers have been made aware of<br>this and they will hopefully fix the problems soon. But if the problem persists,<br>it might be wise to contact the wombat-foo developers at dev@wombat.apache.org.<br><br>More information on foobar-blah in relation to gump can be found at:<br><br>  https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/<br><br>More information on wombat-foo in relation to gump can be found at:<br><br>  https://gump.apache.org/wombat-foo/<br><br>best regards,<br><br><br>- Apache Gump, your continuous integration system<br><br>---<br>You received this e-mail because your project participates in the gump buildsystem.<br>You can configure what notifications gump sends you. Please visit<br>https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/notification-settings for more information.<br></dev></general></pre>
<h3>Frequent dependency failure notifications</h3>
<p>If a piece of software that your project is using keeps breaking or
has been broken for a long time, gump will send you an e-mail. This is
an issue for the same reasons as given above. The difference here is
that the failure has been dragging on for a long time.
</p>
<p>You should probably contact the maintainers of your dependency and
discuss the issue. If it cannot be resolved, it might be a good idea to
reconsider being dependent on this project at all. Here is an example
message:
</p>
<pre>From: Daily gump build <general @gump.apache.org=""><br>To: FooBar Development List <dev
 @foobar.apache.org=""><br>Subject: [Gump] Dependency wombat-foo is causing problems<br><br>Your project is dependent on wombat-foo, which gump has not successfully built<br>for 21 days. If you and the wombat-foo developers are aware of this and<br>working on this issue, you probably can safely ignore this e-mail. If not, it<br>might be wise to contact the wombat-foo developers at dev@wombat.apache.org.<br><br>More information on foobar-blah in relation to gump can be found at:<br><br>  https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/<br><br>More information on wombat-foo in relation to gump can be found at:<br><br>  https://gump.apache.org/wombat-foo/<br><br>best regards,<br><br><br>- Apache Gump, your continuous integration system<br><br>---<br>You received this e-mail because your project participates in the gump buildsystem.<br>You can configure what notifications gump sends you. Please visit<br>https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/notification-settings for more information.<br></dev></general></pre>
<h3>Misconfiguration notifications</h3>
<p>If the metadata descriptor for your project is causing a problem in
some way (invalid XML, specified builds outputs missing, etc), gump
will send you an e-mail.
</p>
<p>Most often, the appropriate action is to fix the descriptor to match
the real situation (for example, make the XML valid or change the
descriptor to reflect the fact that you changed the filename for some
build output). Taking a look at your descriptor is the first thing to
do. In some cases, you might want to change your project in some way so
that what happens matches what your gump descriptor specifies. For
example, you might have a typo in your ant buildfile but not in the
gump descriptor.
</p>
<pre>From: Daily gump build <general @gump.apache.org=""><br>To: FooBar Development List <dev
 @foobar.apache.org=""><br>Subject: [Gump] Problematic descriptor<br><br>The descriptor for foobar-blah has a problem:<br><br>  target/foobar-blah-1.0.jar as an output jar, but that file is not generated.<br><br>All 23 projects dependent on foobar-blah that gump knows about are probably<br>affected by this. Please update either your descriptor or your build system as<br>soon as possible.<br><br>best regards,<br><br><br>- Apache Gump, your continuous integration system<br><br>---<br>You received this e-mail because your project participates in the gump buildsystem.<br>You can configure what notifications gump sends you. Please visit<br>https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/notification-settings for more information.<br></dev></general></pre>
<h3>Missing dependency declaration notifications</h3>
<p>If gump fails to build your project and it is able to detect that
you might not be declaring a dependency (for example if javac issues a
"Symbol not found" error and gump knows what project contains that
symbol, it will send you an e-mail).
</p>
<p>You should check that gump its estimation of the problem is correct,
and if so, change your descriptor to include that dependency. If it
turns out that gump guessed wrong, follow the steps described under
"build failure notifications", below.
</p>
<pre>From: Daily gump build <general @gump.apache.org=""><br>To: FooBar Development List <dev
 @foobar.apache.org=""><br>Subject: [Gump] dependency wombat-foo needs to be declared<br><br>Gump has failed to build your project. It seems that the build is failing<br>because of the following problem:<br><br>   src/java/org/apache/foobar/Blah line 27: cannot find symbol org.apache.wombat.foo.Foo<br><br>The org.apache.wombat.foo package is part of the wombat-foo project, but<br>you have not declared that project as a dependency. You most likely need<br>to add something like the following to your maven project.xml file:<br><br>   <dependency><br>     <artifactId>foobar-blah</artifactId><br>     <groupId>foobar</groupId><br>     <version>SNAPSHOT</version><br>   </dependency><br><br>More information on foobar-blah in relation to gump can be found at:<br><br>  https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/<br><br>More information on wombat-foo in relation to gump can be found at:<br><br>  https://gump.apache.org/wombat-foo/<br><br>best regards,<br><br><br>- Apache Gump, your continuous integration system<br><br>---<br>You received this e-mail because your project participates in the gump buildsystem.<br>You can configure what notifications gump sends you. Please visit<br>https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/notification-settings for more information.<br></dev></general></pre>
<h3>Build failure notifications</h3>
<p>If gump tried to build your project and that failed, it will send
you an e-mail.
</p>
<p>The first thing you probably want to do is get a fresh copy of your
project from version control, and then try to build it with the latest
version of your build software. If that results in the same error, fix
your project so that the error no longer occurs and wait for the next
gump run to complete to be sure that you fixed the problem completely.
</p>
<p>If your project builds fine when you build it by hand but gump does
fail to build your project, the most likely cause is usually some
subtle difference in environment between gump and your local setup. For
example, it could be the case that the java compiler you are using is
more fault-tolerant than the one that gump uses. Compare build output
from your project with build output from gump and try to determine the
issue. Gump has reporting features that attempt to help you with this
diagnosis (for example, we'll show you all the things that changed
since your project built successfully), but often the problem might not
be readily apparent and you will need to "dig into it".

Please visit<br>https://gump.apache.org/foobar-blah/notification-settings for more information.<br></general></pre>
<h2>Editing descriptors</h2>
<h3>Editing gump descriptors</h3>
<p>Gump descriptors are placed either within your project its version
control system (which is the case if you're using maven for example,
where gump utilizes the project.xml file), or inside the gump
subversion repository: </p>
<blockquote><a
 href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gump/trunk/metadata/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gump/trunk/metadata/</a></blockquote>
<p>All ASF committers have read/write access to this part of the gump
repository. If you're not an ASF committer but would like to change
something, please check out the repository and generate a patch, which
you should send to general@gump.apache.org so that someone can apply
it. If you are an ASF committer, please do submit your changes
directly.
</p>
<p>Gump descriptors are XML files. A description of the format of these
files is available at </p>
<blockquote><a
 href="https://gump.apache.org/docs/GumpObjectModelReference">https://gump.apache.org/docs/GumpObjectModelReference</a></blockquote>
<p>Please make sure that changes you make to these files follow the
rules described on those pages (ie, make sure you're writing
well-formed DTD-validated XML). If you have the libxml2 toolkit
installed on your system, you can verify the gump descriptors are
standards-compliant using the command
</p>
<pre>  ./gump validate<br></pre>
<p>within the trunk of the gump SVN repository.
</p>
<p>You do not really need to read and know all of the gump model
details in order to help out with these descriptors. Often, changes are
obvious and trivial (like changing the declared name of build outputs
your project generates). Just take a look at all the other metadata
definitions and use them as examples.
</p>
<h3>Editing maven descriptors</h3>
<p>If your project is built using maven, you do not need a gump
descriptor. Instead, gump parses the maven project.xml files for your
project and extracts all the information it needs from those files. As
long as you take care to make sure your project.xml files are valid and
up-to-date, gump should be able to function properly.
</p>
<h3>Communicating with other projects</h3>
<p>This is probably the most important action item ever on your list.
You will find that it benefits both yourself as well as the software
you're project relates to if you all communicate which each other as
early as possible about any issues you encounter.
</p>
<p>If one of your dependencies is failing to build or one of your
dependees is failing because of your project, you should probably get
in touch with their developers. Gump often gives hints about that by
providing the e-mail address of a development mailing list associated
with a project. We suggest everyone prefixes their messages with
"[Gump]" and includes the name of the project that the message is about
in the subject line.
</p>
<p>For example, the foobar-blah developers may want to send a message
like the following to the wombat-foo developers once some hypothetical
incompatible change occurs:
</p>
<pre>From: John Doe Developer <johndoe @apache.org=""><br>To: Wombat Development List <dev
 @wombat.apache.org=""><br>CC: FooBar Development List <dev
 @foobar.apache.org=""><br>Subject: [Gump] change to wombat-foo impacts foobar-blah<br><br>Hi all!<br><br>You may have noticed already that foobar-blah is recently failing to build with gump.<br>The reason for this seems to be a change to wombat-foo. You guys introduced a new<br>method jump() on org.apache.wombat.foo.Foo, which is marked final. Because of this,<br>the method named jump() in our class org.apache.foobar.blah.BlahFoo (which is a<br>subclass of Foo) is now illegal. Could you guys please remove the 'final' on the<br>jump() method? Or maybe its a better idea to make the method private instead of<br>protected?<br><br><br>thanks,<br><br><br>John Doe<br></dev></dev></johndoe></pre>
<p>You may also find yourself in the reverse situation, where your
client projects suddenly break. Imagine this situation:
</p>
<pre>From: John Dough Developer <johndough @apache.org=""><br>To: FooBar Development List <dev
 @foobar.apache.org="">,<br>    Banana Development List <banana-dev
 @fruit.apache.org=""><br>CC: Wombat Development List <dev
 @wombat.apache.org=""><br>Subject: [Gump] change to wombat-foo impacts foobar-blah<br><br>Hi all!<br><br>You may have noticed already that foobar-blah and banana-boat have started failing<br>to build with gump. The reason for this is that you're still using<br>org.apache.wombat.Foo#dumb(), which has been deprecated for two years now and will<br>be removed in the next release. Please change your code to use notsodumb() instead.<br>For now, I've added back in the dumb() method so you have some time to fix this. We<br>do plan to publish our next release in two weeks or so, so we'd appreciate it if<br>you could make this a priority!<br><br><br>thanks,<br><br><br>John Dough<br></dev></banana-dev></dev></johndough></pre>
<p>Clearly, these kinds of changes and decisions involve things that
Gump cannot realistically know about or advise on. Always realize that
Gump is not perfect, and manual intervention is often required.
</p>
<h2>The "black arts"</h2>
<p>Famous quote from the movie Forrest Gump: </p>
<blockquote>"Life is like a box of chocolates: you never know what
you're gonna get."</blockquote>
<p>while we try to make gump as intelligent, informative and
predictable as possible, there remain many subtle issues for which the
solutions are often far from obvious. When something is broken and
no-one knows why, what we tend to do is debug things like you would any
other issue: with small incremental changes, to see if they fix the
problem.
</p>
<p>Gump has some limited debugging facilities. If you have an account
on the machine where gump runs, you can use the
</p>
<pre>  ./gump run [some-project]<br></pre>
<p>command to try an update and a build of just some-project. This is
allows you to make many small changes and check if they work. If
everything you try still doesn't help, it could be the case that you've
found a bug in gump itself. You can run gump through the python
debugger commandline interface using
</p>
<pre>  ./gump debug [some-project]<br></pre>
<p>You will get a PDB prompt this way. Type help at that prompt for
more information on the available options.
</p>
<p>Note that the gump development team is usually willing and able to
help you do this kind of debugging. To reiterate what was said before:
please do ask questions!
