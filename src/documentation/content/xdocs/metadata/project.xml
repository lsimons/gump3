    <p>A project is the atomic unit of integration.  It can describe an
    installable package or a buildable product.  The nested elements of
    a project definition fall into three different "groups", each optional:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><link href="builder.html">Build instructions</link>:
    &lt;ant&gt;, &lt;nant&gt;, &lt;mvn1&gt;, &lt;mvn2&gt;, &lt;mvn3&gt;,
    &lt;gradle&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;configure&gt;, &lt;make&gt; and &lt;msbuild&gt;.<br/>
          Describes how to produce the outputs from the inputs.</li>
    <li>Inputs: &lt;depend&gt;, &lt;option&gt;, and &lt;work&gt;.  Describes
    where to find the inputs (primarily jar files, but can be directories and
    files).</li>
    <li>Outputs: &lt;home&gt;, &lt;license&gt;, &lt;jar&gt;, &lt;pom&gt; and &lt;output&gt;.  Describes where to locate
    the output files.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Specifies the name of a required prerequisite project.  If a
      definition for that project is not found in the workspace, the
      generation will fail.</p>

      <p>For a build "all", the invocation of ant or the script is bypassed
      if any of the outputs of the specified project can not be found.</p>

      <p>For both script and ant based builds, any jars defined by the

    <section><title>work</title>
      <p>Adds a directory or a file to the class path.  This is to allow
      projects which have compilation dependencies on byproducts of the build
      (e.g., tests which import the project itself).  This is necessary when
      using the Ant build.sysclasspath="ignore".</p>

      <p>If the directory is not present prior to the build, some VMs
      may drop it from the CLASSPATH.  If this happens, use a <link
      href="#mkdir">&lt;mkdir&gt;</link> element to create it before
      building the project.</p>

      <p>If this directory is deleted during the course of the build,
      the behavior of the JVM may become unpredictable.  The same is
      true if the element points to a jar file and that file is
      modified during the build.</p>

      <p>If neither the parent nor the nested attributes are present, then
      the srcdir for the module is added to the classpath.</p>

      <p>Note that the entries specified by &lt;work&gt; elements are
      prepended to the class path.  If a class can be found both in a
      &lt;work&gt; entry and a jar refered to by &lt;depend&gt;, the
      one from the &lt;work&gt; entry will be loaded.</p>

    <section><title>home</title>
      <p>The home directory for a project is the directory which contains the
      files referenceable by another project.  In many cases, it is possible
      for another project element by the same name (see the
      <link href="index.html">overview</link>) to extend a project definition
      for an installable package in such a way that the result actually builds
      the project.</p>

      <p>A home attribute on a project definition will override this value.</p>

      <p>A package attribute on a project will provide a default for this
      value.  Such a default would be relative to the workspace pkgdir</p>

      <p>If none of these attributes or elements, the default value is
      the srcdir for the module.</p>

      <p>&lt;javadoc&gt; supports a nested &lt;description&gt;

      project. &lt;description&gt; itself only supports nested
      text and an optional dir attribute.</p>

      <p>The &lt;javadoc&gt; elements of all projects are used to
      create two pages, &quot;javadoc.html&quot; (like

        <link href="#">label</link> - description<br/><br/></li>

        <li>There are several &lt;javadoc&gt; elements associated with
        the module, their labels are different from the name of the
        module - the result will look like<br/><br/>
        <strong>name of the module</strong> - description of the module
        <br/>
            <link href="#">label</link> - description<br/>
            <link href="#">label2</link> - description2<br/>
        </li>

        <li>There are several &lt;javadoc&gt; elements associated with
        the module, their labels are all the same as the name of the

            <link href="#">description2</link><br/>

      <p><em>label</em> in this lists will be created from the project

      <!--p>&lt;junitreport&gt; supports a nested &lt;description&gt;
      element, which can be used to set the title in the junitreport
      listing.  If no &lt;description&gt; element has been specified,
      the title defaults to the description of the
      project. &lt;description&gt; itself only supports nested
      text and an optional dir attribute.</p>

      <p>The &lt;junitreport&gt; elements of all projects are used to
      create a single page, &quot;junitreport.html&quot; (like 
      <link href="http://lsd.student.utwente.nl/gump/junitreport.html">this</link>)
      listing the available sets of junit reports.</p>

      <p>There are three different layouts a &lt;junitreport&gt; element
      may create in the junitreport listing &quot;junitreport.html&quot;:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>This is the only &lt;junitreport&gt; element associated with
        the module, the result will look like<br/><br/>
        <link href="#">label</link> - description<br/><br/></li>

        <li>There are several &lt;junitreport&gt; elements associated with
        the module, their labels are different from the name of the
        module - the result will look like<br/><br/>
        <strong>name of the module</strong> - description of the module
        <br/>
            <link href="#">label</link> - description<br/>
            <link href="#">label2</link> - description2<br/>
        </li>

        <li>There are several &lt;junitreport&gt; elements associated with
        the module, their labels are all the same as the name of the
        module - the result will look like<br/><br/>
        <strong>name of the module</strong> - description of the module
        <br/>
            <link href="#">description</link><br/>
            <link href="#">description2</link><br/>
        </li>

      </ol>

      <p><em>label</em> in this lists will be created from the project
      attribute and <em>description</em> from the description child
      element of &lt;junitreport&gt;</p>

      <p>If a given project wants to publish more than one junitreport
      set, multiple &lt;description&gt; elements like in</p>

    <section><title>nag</title>
      <p>If this element is present, an entry for this project will be

      <!--p>The regexp element supports the same attributes as the nag
      element with an additional (required) pattern attribute.  This
      attribute specifies the Perl regular expression to be used when

      <p>The nag element itself can be used to set default values for
      nested child elements:</p>

      <source>
&lt;nag from=&quot;from@example.org&quot; to=&quot;to@example.org&quot; /&gt;

</source>

       <p>
         Multiple <code>regexp</code> elements may be specified. The
         first pattern that matches will be the one used to send the
         nag email.

       <p>
         To send email on success or failure, you could use:

&lt;nag&gt;
  &lt;!- - pattern default is /BUILD FAILED/i - -&gt;
  &lt;regexp from=&quot;from@example.org&quot;

      <p>
        You may want to nag on deprecation if you are particularly
        sensitive to a given dependency. The nag for that would
        look like this:
